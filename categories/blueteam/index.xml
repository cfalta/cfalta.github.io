      <description>A defenders perspective on msDS-KeyCredentialLink
TL;DR;
This article is about my journey into tracing changes to the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute to verify if their origin is legitimate or a potential attack (aka. Shadow Credentials). If you just want to know the &amp;ldquo;gist&amp;rdquo; of it, scroll down to the bottom and you&amp;rsquo;ll find a mindmap.
What&amp;rsquo;s msDS-KeyCredentialLink and why should I care? The msDS-KeyCredentialLink (aka. &amp;ldquo;kcl&amp;rdquo;) attribute can be used to link an RSA key pair with a computer or user object in order to authenticate with said key pair against the KDC to receive a Kerberos TGT.</description>

      <description>I remember that, about 15 years ago, we already flagged the absence of SMB signing as a vulnerability in reports. Though at that time, we circled more around the theoretical risk of someone tampering SMB traffic due to the lack of integrity protection. None of us really had an idea how to make use of that vulnerability. The later obviously changed.
July 2021 came and brought with it a storm of various Print Spooler RCEs (PrintNightmare), one of the simplest LPE&amp;rsquo;s Windows has seen (HiveNightmare,seriousSAM) and a little hippo (PetitPotam) who anchored the &amp;ldquo;NTLM problem&amp;rdquo; in the center of our attention.</description>
