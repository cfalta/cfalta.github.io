      <description>I remember that, about 15 years ago, we already flagged the absence of SMB signing as a vulnerability in reports. Though at that time, we circled more around the theoretical risk of someone tampering SMB traffic due to the lack of integrity protection. None of us really had an idea how to make use of that vulnerability. The later obviously changed.
July 2021 came and brought with it a storm of various Print Spooler RCEs (PrintNightmare), one of the simplest LPE&amp;rsquo;s Windows has seen (HiveNightmare,seriousSAM) and a little hippo (PetitPotam) who anchored the &amp;ldquo;NTLM problem&amp;rdquo; in the center of our attention.</description>
