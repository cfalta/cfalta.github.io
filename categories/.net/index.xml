      <description>Did you ever wonder how process suspension in Windows works? Nevermind, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this anyway.
Since you&amp;rsquo;re reading this blog you&amp;rsquo;re either totatlly lost or into Windows anyway. So I assume you alread tried suspending and resuming a process with process explorer for example. There are actually different ways to suspend a process and we&amp;rsquo;ll go with the one that&amp;rsquo;s officially undocumented (more fun).
NTSuspendProcess The API we&amp;rsquo;re using is called NTSuspendProcess and lives inside NTDLL.</description>

      <description>TL;DR; The newest addition to PSArmoury is a small utility script called ConvertTo-Powershell. It allows to &amp;ldquo;convert&amp;rdquo; a C# console application into a powershell script or in other words it creates a .ps1 file from a .exe file. This can be useful for bypassing AWL or AV software and if you are a similar PS-lunatic like myself, it&amp;rsquo;s also just fun :-)
From exe to ps1 If you read one of my previous posts, you might already know that I prefer to do stuff in Powershell.</description>
